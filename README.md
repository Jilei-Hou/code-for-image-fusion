This repository will list some codes of image fusion, including infrared and visible image fusion, medical image fusion, multi-focus image fusion, and multi-exposure image fusion. All fusion methods can be divided into **traditional fusion methods** and **deep leaening-based fusion methods**. For deep leaening-based fusion methods, I will provide link of open source code. For traditional fusion methods, I will give the code.

If you need the evaluation index of image fusion, you can find it [here](https://github.com/Jilei-Hou/metric-for-image-fusion)
