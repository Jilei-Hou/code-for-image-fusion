### Description
This package contains the source code and dataset used in the following paper:
"Yu Zhang, Lijia Zhang, Xiangzhi Bai and Li Zhang. Infrared and Visual Image Fusion through Infrared Feature Extraction and Visual Information Preservation, Infrared Physics & Technology 83 (2017) 227-237."

Usage of this code is only free for research purposes. Please refer to the above publication if you use this code. 

You can run the script Main.m to see the fusion demo.
This demo is implemented by Yu Zhang (uzeful@163.com).

### Note
We are sorry that the bezier matrix M in this paper is not correct, but the code has been correctly implemented and thus it does not impact the fusion results. 
In this note, we want to share you with the correct bezier matrix M, that is  
[-1 3 -3 1;  
 3 -6 3 0;  
 -3 3 0 0;  
 1 0 0 0].
