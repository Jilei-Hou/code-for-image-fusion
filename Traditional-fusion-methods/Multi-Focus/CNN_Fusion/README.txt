This package contains the MATLAB code which is associated with the following paper:

Yu Liu, Xun Chen, Hu Peng, Zengfu Wang "Multi-focus image fusion with a deep convolutional neural network", INFORMATION FUSION, vol.36, pp.191-207, 2017.

Edited by Yu Liu.   

Usage of this code is free for research purposes only. 

Please refer to the above publication if you use this code. Thank you.

The demo file is Script.m.

The CNN model is learned by Caffe and then converted into a '.mat' file. 

Please note that the running time reported in the paper is implemented with C++ using Caffe GPU mode. The results obtained with this MATLAB implementation could be used for comparison with your methods. The computational speed is relatively low using MATLAB (about two minutes on a 3.6GHz CPU).
