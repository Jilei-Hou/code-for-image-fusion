This package contains the code which is associated with the following paper:
Y. Liu and Z. Wang, "Simultaneous image fusion and denoising with adaptive sparse representation". IET Image Processing,vol.9,no.5,pp.347-357,2015

Usage of this code is free for research purposes only. 

Please refer to the above publication if you use this code.

Please note that the fused mean value is obtained by averaing the source mean values in this current implementation, which is different from the description in the paper. Actually, both of these two strategies are fine for multi-focus image fusion, but the averaging strategy seems to be more stable for multi-modal image fusion. This is the only difference between this implmentation and the approaches presented in the paper. Please take this code as the standard implementation of the method proposed in the paper for performance comparison in your work.
